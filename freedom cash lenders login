Governments continue with their attempts to clamp down on payday loan regulations. In several countries, lawmakers are trying to make it more difficult for the average person to obtain a fast cash loan. Their motives are based on protecting citizens from falling further in debt. On the other hand, their methods are not as accepted. Clamping down on safe payday loan providers services and limiting access to emergency help has not proven overly successful. In fact, for many borrowers, it has made their situation worse.

It is true that payday loans are not a good solution for many people in a budget crunch. The interest is high and the payoff term is fast. People who continuously struggle with money issues are less successful with this type of money help. The 'cycle of debt' skyrockets once a short-term loan enters in. The root of the borrower's financial problems is masked by the end result. There are major contributing factors to a household's budget demise. Why the debt problems for lower income individuals are left to hang on the heads of a direct lender remains a conundrum.
